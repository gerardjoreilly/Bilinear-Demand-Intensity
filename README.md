# Computation of MAFE using Bilinear Demand-Intensity Models

This repository contains files related to  computing the mean annual frequency of exceedance (MAFE) for a given limit state for structural systems whose structural demand versus seismic intensity is best represented using a bilinear representation in logspace.

The two files, one a MS Excel sheet and the other a Matlab function, both perform the same operations to compute the MAFE using the proposed extension.
